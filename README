You can install this module by issuing the following command:

    python setup.py install

To build a Python "egg", use the following:

    python seutp.py bdist_egg
    # Copy the .egg file from under the "dist" folder



Here is a simple usage example:

    from logging import getLogger, INFO
    from cloghandler import ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler
    import os
    
    log = getLogger()
    # Use an absolute path to prevent file rotation trouble.
    logfile = os.path.abspath("mylogfile.log")
    # Rotate log after reaching 512K, keep 5 old copies.
    rotateHandler = ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler(logfile, "a", 512*1024, 5)
    log.addHandler(rotateHandler)
    log.setLevel(INFO)
    
    log.info("Here is a very exciting log message, just for you")



To use this module from a logging config file, use a handler entry like this:

    [handler_hand01]
    class=handlers.ConcurrentRotatingFileHandler
    level=NOTSET
    formatter=form01
    args=("rotating.log", "a", 512*1024, 5)

Note: you must have a "import cloghandler" before you call fileConfig(). For
more information see http://docs.python.org/lib/logging-config-fileformat.html



NOTES: This module has not yet be tested in a multi-threaded environment. I see
no reason why this should be an issue, but no stress-testing has been done in a
threaded situation. If this is important to you, you could always add threading
support to the stresstest.py script and send me the patch.
